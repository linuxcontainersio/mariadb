## What is Alpine Linux?
Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. The image is only 10 MB in size and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications. Read more about Alpine Linux here and you can see how their mantra fits in right at home with Docker images.
